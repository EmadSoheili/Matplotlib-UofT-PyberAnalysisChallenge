## Overview of the Analysis

The analysis has been conducted to illustrate the "Total Fare" during a period of time in different city types. Not only can this enable us to see total amount of fares over time, but also it will provide us with a great tool for camparing fares in different city types.

## Analysis Phases

  1. Import Datasets
  2. Merge two datasets
  3. Calculation of **Weekly Fares** in **Different City Types** over a **Specific Period of Time**
  4. Create the desired visaluzation

According to above multi-line chart and the summary DataFrame, the following insights has been extracted.
  * Considering total amount of Fare, Urban city type is ranked first, Suburban city type is ranked second, and the Rural city type is at the third place.
    * Pyber has earned nearly $40,000 in Urban areas, which is almost 10 times higher than. Rural areas.
    * The most thrived type of city is Urban area, considering total amount of Fare.
  * Total number of Rides and Drivers are also follow the pattern explained for Total Fares.
  * However, considering average Fare per Ride, Rural areas is placed at the first rank.
    * This means for every single ride in these areas, PyBer will earn more.
  * For average Fare per driver, the story is the same. Rural areas are at the first place the with average Fare over three times higher than Urban areas.
    * This is because not only is average Fare per ride, higher in these areas, but also each driver will have more rides during the considered period.
    * Despite the fact that there is a noise in the chart during the considered period, the Fare amounts are relatively constant and there were no significant upsurge or drop in the trend (except a couple of times).
